# Preparation of TAP+P media

## Introduction

This protocol describes the steps to make TAP+P (additional phosphate) media by combining reagents and other stock solutions. This protocol produces 1L of media.

## Overview

1. Preparation of solution
2. Titration to pH 7.0 $\pm$ 0.2
3. Send for autoclave at 121ºC for 20mins

## Requirements

1. Tris - Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 99% (Alfa Aesar)
2. Stock Salt Solution
3. Potassium Phosphate Solution
4. Hutner's trace elements (Chlamydomonas Resource Center) stored at 4ºC cold storage.
5. Glacial acetic acid ACS, 99.7+% (Alfa Aesar)
6. 1L distille'deionized water (dd $H_2O$)
7. 1X 1L beaker
8. 3X 0.5L Shott Bottles
9. Magnetic stirrer and plate
10. pH measurement machine (ideally accumet on the ground floor) and pH paper.

## 1. Preparation of solution

1. | **Compound**                 | **Amount** |
	| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
	| Tris                         | 2.42 g     |
	| Salt solution                | 25 mL      |
	| Potassium phosphate solution | 1.5 mL     |
	| Hutner’s trace elements      | 1.0 mL     |
	| Glacial acetic acid          | ~ 1.8 mL   |

​	Combine the first 4 compounds in a beaker (1L).

2. Add dd $H_2O$ to **1 L**.
3. Start magnetic stirring.

## 2. Titration to pH 7.0 $\pm$ 0.2

1. Calibrate the pH meter (check the calibration procedure for the particular pH machine). The pH meter should ideally be calibrated frequently, after every 2 successive measurements.
	1. Remove the protective cap from the electrode
	2. Place the electrode inside a beaker, using the arm of the pH Meter to move it carefully, and clean it with distilled water
	3. Calibration: click on the button “Cal” and submerge the electrode inside a buffer of pH=7.0
	4. Clean the electrode with distilled water again
	5. Slowly submerge the electrode inside the solution
	6. Wait until stabilization and annotate the pH value
	7. Remove the electrode from the solution, clean it with distilled water and replace the protective cap.
2. Measure the **pH** of the solution, which should be **8-9** initially. Note it down.
3. Titrate to **pH=7.0** with glacial acetic acid, pour in small steps with a pipette boy, while mixing. 
	Note: Open the glacial acetic acid under a fume hood. The fumes are nauseous and toxic. Also be very slow near pH of 7.0, since it takes a while for the solution to stabilize (when the solution starts to turn clear).
4. Store in glass bottles (fill ~350mL for a 500mL shott bottle).

## 3. Send for autoclave at 121ºC for 20mins

1. Label the bottle on a paper label: [TAP-STOCKNUMBER, LP, DATE]
2. Using a simple marker write on the glass "121ºC for 20mins"
3. Send to autoclave.
4. Log the pH of the stocks on the lab board and update digital records.



## Conclusions

The final concentrations of TAP+P media will be:
