# Preparation of TAP+P media

## Introduction

+ This protocol describes the steps to make TAP+P (additional phosphate) media by combining reagents and other stock solutions. This protocol produces 1L of media.
+ For making TAP+P - Acetate media, use HCL instead of acetate.
+ Overview
	1. Preparation of solution
	1. Titration to pH 7.0 $\pm$ 0.2
	1. Filter and autoclave


## Requirements

1. Tris - Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 99% (Alfa Aesar)
2. Stock Salt Solution
3. Potassium Phosphate Solution
4. Hutner's trace elements (Chlamydomonas Resource Center) stored at 4ºC cold storage.
5. Glacial acetic acid ACS, 99.7+% (Alfa Aesar) or Hydrochloric acid 37% (for minimal media)
6. 1L distilled deionized water (dd $H_2O$)
7. 1X 1L beaker
8. 3X 0.5L Shott Bottles
9. Magnetic stirrer and plate
10. pH measurement machine (ideally accumet on the ground floor) and pH paper.
11. Laminar flow hood with vaccum line and silicone tubing
12. 0.22um membrane sterile filters (Sarsted Filtropur 500mL filters Catalogue number: 83.3941.511). **1 filter per 2L of media.**



## Steps

###  1. Preparation of solution

1. | **Compound**                 | **Amount** |
	| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
	| Tris                         | 2.42 g     |
	| Salt solution                | 25 mL      |
	| Potassium phosphate solution | 1.5 mL     |
	| Hutner’s trace elements      | 1.0 mL     |
	| Glacial acetic acid          | ~ 1.8 mL   |

​	Combine the first 4 compounds in a beaker (1L).

2. Add dd $H_2O$ to **1 L**.
3. Start magnetic stirring.

###  2. Titration to pH 7.0 $\pm$ 0.2

1. Calibrate the pH meter (check the calibration procedure for the particular pH machine). The pH meter should ideally be calibrated frequently, after every 2 successive measurements.
	1. Remove the protective cap from the electrode
	2. Place the electrode inside a beaker, using the arm of the pH Meter to move it carefully, and clean it with distilled water
	3. Calibration: click on the button “Cal” and submerge the electrode inside a buffer of pH=7.0
	4. Clean the electrode with distilled water again
	5. Slowly submerge the electrode inside the solution
	6. Wait until stabilization and annotate the pH value
	7. Remove the electrode from the solution, clean it with distilled water and replace the protective cap.
2. Measure the **pH** of the solution, which should be **8-9** initially. Note it down.
3. Titrate to **pH=7.0** with glacial acetic acid (or HCL), pour in small steps with a pipette boy, while mixing. 
	Note: Open the glacial acetic acid under a fume hood. The fumes are nauseous and toxic. Also be very slow near pH of 7.0, since it takes a while for the solution to stabilize (when the solution starts to turn clear).

### 3. Filter and autoclave

1. Move the beakers to a Laminar flow hood with vaccum and connect the silicone pipe.
2. Attach the membrane filters to the Shott bottles and connect them to vacuum. Control the vaccum such that the media trickles down the bottle. Replace the filter for every 2L of media.
3. Label the bottle on a paper label: [TAP-STOCKNUMBER, LP, DATE]
4. Using a simple marker write on the glass "121ºC for 20mins"
5. Send to autoclave.
6. Log the pH of the stocks on the lab board and update digital records.
