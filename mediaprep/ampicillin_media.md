# Preparation of TAP+P media

## Introduction

This protocol describes the steps to make TAP+P (additional phosphate) media by combining reagents and other stock solutions. This protocol produces 1L of media. We begin with a test with the final concentration of $25 \mu g / mL $ of Ampicillin in TAP+P Liquid media.

Recommended concentrations (check yaml frontmatter for full-references):

- Chlamydomonas sourcebook: $25-100 \mu g/mL$ : on agar plates for clearance of contaminated cultures.
- BioTechniques: $100 \mu g/mL$ Ampicillin + $50 \mu g / mL$ Cefotaxime : on agar plates

## Overview

1. Measurement of relevant concentration.
2. Mixing into autoclaved TAP+P or minimal media.

## Requirements

1. Media stock (TAP+P/Minimal/etc) and stored at 4ºC.
2. Ampicillin sodium salt (Sigma Aldrich A9518-5G)
3. Precision weight balance scale
4. LAminar flow hood.

## Procedure

1. **Measurement of relevant concentration:**
	For a final concentration of $25 \mu g / mL $ in $1L$ of media, isolate $25mg$ on a precision balance. 
2. **Mixing into autoclaved TAP+P or minimal media:**
	Add to the media stock bottle. Close the lid and stir the bottle until the media is completely dissolved.
3. Seperate into different bottles as per the requirements. And store at 4ºC.
