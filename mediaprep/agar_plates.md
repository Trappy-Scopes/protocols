# Protocol for preparation of agar plates

## Overview

1. Preparation of agar solution and autoclaving at 121ºC at 20mins.
2. Preparation of petri plates
3. Storage of plates

## Requirements

1. BactoAgar powder (BD Difco Bacto Dehydrated Agar)
2. TAP+P media stocks (300mL for ~10 plates)
3. 10X Petri dishes
4. 1X beaker 1L.
5. Magentic stirrer and plate
6. Microwave
7. Laminar flow / flame (sterile conditions)

## 1. Preparation of agar solution

1. Add  **1.5 %** (w/v) (**4.50gm**) of agar to **~ 300 mL** of TAP (weight the agar powder on a beaker and then add the TAP+P liquid media).
2. Mix with a magnetic stirrer with no heating. The dissolution will be done *a posteriori*, before filling the Petri plates.
3. Store the solution in a glass bottle, not completely full to allow for liquid expansion during the posterior melting.
4. Label ["LP", DATE, AgarStock-STOCKNUMBER] on a paper label and send to autoclave (for **20 min**, at **121 ºC**), **with no water bath**.
5. Collect from the autoclave and store at room temperature.

## 2. Petri plates preparation

1. Melt small volumes (**~ 300 mL**) of agar containing TAP+P in the microwave (around **4 min** in total). Very importantly, the bottle lid must be twisted, leaving the bottle unsealed (but not open), otherwise it may explode.

2. After a while (**1-2 min**), check the solution for solid material, and slowly agitate it, holding the bottle and making small circles in the air (use gloves!). The solution might expand due to overheating of the liquid fraction, so the agitation must be done with care.

3. Heat the solution until no more solid material is present (it should look translucid with a brownish colour).

4. Lay out plates and bring the bottle to a sterile place (laminar flow /flame) and then open.

5. Pour the solution in 25 mL Petri dishes, until all the liquid portions are joined together, covering the whole plate base (approximately half plate height).

6. Do not dispose the plates on top of each other, to reduce condensation effects. Leave them at room temperature. After some time, once the agar is solid, they can be stored (see Fig. 1 below).

## Additional information

1. *Agar solutions are commonly used in culture media, due to its chemico-physical properties: melting point of 85-95 ºC, setting point of 32-45 ºC, it’s insoluble in cold water but easily dissolved in boiling water, with a very high absorbance (up to 20 times its weight), setting as a firm gel at very low concentrations. In its dry state, it’s aseptic, being mixed with nutrients to create the perfect environment for a certain organism development.*

2. *Note: It should be avoided to expose agar solutions to high temperatures and pH <* *6.0 for long periods.*
