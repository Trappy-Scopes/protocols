# Preparation of Stock solutions

+ Overview:

	1. Preparation of salt solution (~1L)

	2. Preparation of phosphate solution  (~1L)


## Requirements

1. Shott bottles (0.5L, and 1L)

2. Beakers (>1L)

3. Magnetic stirrer and plates

4. pH meter

5. Salt solution
  1. $NH_4Cl$ powder (chemlab - CL0011461000)
  2. $MgSO_4•7H_2O$ powder (chemlab - CL0013021000)
  3. $CaCl_2•2H_2O$ powder (chemlab - CL0003170250)
  4. 1L dd $H_2O$

6. Potassium phosphate solution
  1. $K_2HPO_4$ powder (chemlab - CL0011561000)

  2. $KH_2PO_4$ powder (chemlab - CL0011461000)

  3. 1L dd $H_2O$

  	

Note: The first stocks were made using borrowed reagents from "unknown" sources.



## Steps

###  1. Preparation of salt solution (~1L)

1. Add the following compounds to a beaker:

| **Compound**   | **Amount** | **Concentration** |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| $NH_4Cl$       | 15.0 g     | 280 m*M*          |
| $MgSO_4•7H_2O$ | 4.0 g      | 16.2 m*M*         |
| $CaCl_2•2H_2O$ | 2.0 g      | 13.6 m*M*         |

2. Add to **1 L** of distilled-deionized water (dd $H_2O$).
3. Mix with a magnetic stirrer without heating, rotating only the stirring button.
4. Store in a glass bottle.
5. Label ["LP", DATE, "Salt Solution Stock"] and send to autoclave (for **20 min,** at **121 ºC**).
6. Store at **4 ºC** (cold room).

###  2. Preparation of phosphate solution  (~1L)

1. Add the following compounds to a beaker:

| **Compound** | **Amount** | **Concentration** |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| $K_2HPO_4$   | 288.0 g    | 1.65 *M*          |
| $KH_2PO_4$   | 144.0 g    | 1.06 *M*          |

2. Add up to **1 L** of dd $H_2O$.
3. Mix with a magnetic stirrer without warming up.
4. Measure the pH, it should read **7.4**.
5. Store in a glass bottle.
6. Label ["LP", DATE, "Potassium phosphate Solution Stock", pH]  and send to autoclave (for **20 min**, at **121 ºC**).
7. Store at room temperature.
