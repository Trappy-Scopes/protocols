## Macro Steps

### Morning

1. Gather equipment and expendables.
2. Process cells and dilute the cells for the next day.
3. Trap cells.
4. Start recording.

### Afternoon

1. Check cells again for stability (proving difficult with mjpeg).
2. Clean traps and prepare the next set of microfluidics.
3. Do cleanroom rounds if required.

## Detailed Steps

### Morning
0. Check the thermostat of the lab and adjust to the current temperature.
1. Set data transfers and reboot computers, and start trappy-scopes cli, set white light and open long previews. (skip if the experiments are already running).

2. Take out media from the fridge and set aside to warm (both for experiments and daily dilutions).
3. Clean the wet bench space with ethanol, also clean pipettes, tip cases etc.
4. Mount 8-traps (set of 8: dry and sterile).
  1. Attach tubing and stopcocks.
  2. Mount to each of the sample stages and bring to focus.
  3. Update the trap information on the microscope (microfluidics device id).
  4. Fill 8 syringes with TAP+P (2 mL) and use them to purge the traps.
5. Bring out the cells and start processing cultures.
  1.  Take cells in their log phase: $10^5$ cells per mL (which are passaged daily).
  2. Remove a portion for doing daily dilutions: *about 10%*. (culture for the next day).
  3. Take the rest of the culture and replace cap with parafilm and put in the incubator for separation.
  4. Let cells sediment for 5 mins under illumination without any shaking.
  5. Extract the supernatant: About 25-50% fraction.
  6. Centrifuge the cells 'gently' for 3mins at 100g.
  7. Remove the top 25% fraction of the culture and isolate in a sterile tube (cover the tube in black tape).
  8. Count the isolated fraction and add media to set the density to $\approx 5 \times 10^5$ cells per mL (required volume = 16mL to 20mL)
6. Load 8 syringes with 2mL of cell cultures each and cover them with black paper.
7. Add the syringes to the other stopcock without creating bubbles and open the valves, this should equalise the pressure. Make sure that the lights are off during the weight period.
8. Loading cells - for each microscope:
  1. Set low-intensity white/green light.
  2. Let about 0.25mL of culture pass before trying to confine cells.
  3. Confine a "low contrast, small, fast" cell.
  4. Once the cell is trapped, leave the stopcocks in closed positions.
  5. Set light conditions to the desired color and voltage.
  6. Move to the next microscope.
  7. If air creeps in by any chance, set the traps to purge air again and move to another microscope. Return after 10mins and try to trap a cell again.
9. After the process is complete on all microscopes, check all the microscopes again for a single swimming cell. In case the cell has escaped, etc, purge and load again. The whole process should take less than 1.5 hours.
10. Once all the microscopes are ready, start the recording script.
11. Done (Lunch time)!

###  Afternoon

12. Check cells again for stability (proving difficult with mjpeg) :: **not possible for now. Some script adjustments are required.**
13. Clean traps and prepare the next set of microfluidics:
	1. Remove the syringes and stopcocks, and clear the cultures inside them. Place them in seperate bins.
	2. Connect the pumps to the microfluidics using the Leur locks and put the other end in a measuring cyclinder.
	3. Set forward pump rates such that the outflux is about 1 drop per second.
	4. Purge the following:
		1. 3mL of MilliQ (10 mins)
		2. 3mL of 0.1% Tween 20  (10 mins)
		3. 3mL of MilliQ  (10 mins)
		4. 3mL of 20% Ethanol  (10 mins)
		5. 3mL of MilliQ (10mins)
		6. Airpurge by hand
14. Remove tubings and put them in their respective bins.
15. Place the devices on 95% hot plate for a few hours / overnight.
16. Repeat for the other set.
17. Add bleach to the collected culture and trash appropriately.
18. Prepare the next round of microfluidics:
	1. Set of 8
	2. 16 tubes with needles (autoclaved)
	3. 16 syringes
	4. 16 stopcocks
19. Go home!
