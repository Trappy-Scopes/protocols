# Master Protocol for cell trapping

## Introduction

0. Begin meta-experiment and log everything.

### Part I

1. Start UV treatment of microfluidics, clean bench, and transfer BSA solution to water bath.
2. Check cultures and begin processing them; begin acclimation for 20mins.
3. Start BSA treatment andmicroscopes.
4. Trap cells.

### Part II

1. Cleanup
2. Count cell culture
3. Clean microfluidics (if required)



## Steps

0. **Start UV treatment of microfluidics, clean bench, and transfer BSA solution to water bath:** Microfluidics are already placed in a UV chamber, start UV treatment for a set durtation: **UV-A 15W lamp for 30mins**. Clean every surface, all keyboards, all mice, and personal phone with Ethanol. Transfer BSA solution from the fridge to a water bath. Transfer to a small bottle if required.
1. **Check cultures and begin processing them; begin acclimation for 20mins:** Take samples of a few cultures and check motility, size, and contamination state under the microscope. Chose the best and isolate $20\mu L$ for cell counting. Transfer the culture to an opaque centrifuge tube under asceptic conditions, and cover the tube with parafilm before caping. Centrifuge at **200g** for **10mins**. After centrifuging, light separate the cultures for **1-2 minutes**. Isolate about $V_r \approx0.5-1.5mL$ from the top carefully and dilute to $20mL$ using fresh media. Check the [experiments README](../README.md) for determination of exact values.
2. **Isolate an ecosystem culture**: If there is also a need to isolate a dense culture along with the regular one. Pipette $V_r + 0.2mL$ and dilute the additional $0.2mL$ to $1mL$ in an epindorf tube and transfer to a sterile syringe using a pipette.
3.  **Start BSA treatment andmicroscopes**: Extract BSA in a 20mL syringe and purge the microfluidic devices with BSA under pressure using a $0.22\mu m$ syringe filter. Let them incubate for 30mins before flusing with $1.5mL$ of fresh media. Verify SSD space, and create experiments on each microscope. Verify that the folder was reflected on the NAS. Especially for the ecossystem scope. Mount the traps on each of the microscopes and align the devices.
4. **Trap cells**: Trap in groups of four, by breaking the BSA treatment in groups of four. Trap the ecosystem scope first because it is the easiest. Follow the flag conventions in the additional information section below.
5. **Cleanup:** Recycle the paper and plastic. Clean the bench with ethanol, and dispose the cultures with bleach if necessary.
6. **Count cell culture** and update the metaexperiment.
7. **Clean microfluidics (if required)**.

## Additional Information

1. **Blue flag**:  Scope is aligned and trap and sample information has been updated.
2. **Yellow flag X1**: Cell is trapped. Waiting 10mins to check.
3. **Yellow flag X2**: Checkpoint 1 is reached. Waiting another 10 mins.
4. **Green flag: ** Cells acclimated for 20mins and is a single swimming cell. The scope is ready to acquire.
5. **Red flag:** Air bubbles, the trap is being purged.
6. **Pink flag X1:** Cell not spotted after trapping. Wait 10 more minutes.
7. **Pink flag X2**: Cell not spotted after trapping. Wait another 10 minutes, before changing to a red flag.
8. **White flag:** Microfluidic device broken without replacement. The scope has surrendered.
