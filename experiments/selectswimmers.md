# Protocol for selecting swimmers

Selection of swimmers from a batch culture of CR is performed to get a low density of cells which have both flagella intact, i.e. good swimmers.

Preferably, this procedure should be done after an hour of the beginning of the light cycle (i.e. 9AM).


## Requirements

1. Cell culture of CR
2. Opaque conical tubes for centrifuge
3. Shott bottle for dilluted culture
4. Fresh media
5. (optional) Ballast for centrifuge
6. Centrifuge
7. Enclosure with strong light on the top/incubator



## Steps

0. Select cultures that are in the log growth phase and check them under the microscope to characterise motility. A small-medium fraction of cells must be motile and also there should be presence of a lot of small cells. Also check if the cultures are clean — no small moving dots (bacteria), branched web structures (fungi), or a lot of lysed cells (indicator of infection). 

1. Transfer the cultures to an opaque concial centrifuge tube with proper aseptic standards. Before closing the tube, add a layer of parafilm on top.

2. Place the cell culture in the centrifuge and spin at **200rcf (g)** for **10 minutes**. These number change from one strain to the other.

3. After the centrifugation finishes, put it in the incubator with a strong light source on the top.

4. Incubate for **2-3mins **for **light separation**. During this time good swimmers swim to the top.
	
5. After this is done, isolate $\approx 0.5-1.5mL$ based on density of the raw culture. It is okay to identify densities based on color.

	| Color                                        | Extract volume |
	| -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
	| Dark green: $5\cdot10^5$ to $10^6$  cells/mL | 0.5mL          |
	| Light green: $10^4$ to $10^5$ cells/mL       | 1mL            |
	| Very light green: $\approx 10^4$ cells/mL    | 1.5mL          |
	
6. Extract the said volume, and dilute the culture to $20mL$ using fresh media.

7. The culture is ready for use. Shade the shott bottle with Aluminium foil or a proper system and store in a dark place for dark acclimation.
