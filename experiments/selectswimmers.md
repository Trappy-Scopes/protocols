# Protocol for selecting swimmers

Selection of swimmers from a batch culture of CR is performed to get a low density of cells which have both flagella intact, i.e. good swimmers.

Preferably, this procedure should be done after an hour of the beginning of the light cycle (i.e. 9AM).


## Requirements

1. Cell culture of CR
2. Opaque conical tubes for centrifuge
3. Shott bottle for dilluted culture
4. Fresh media
5. (optional) Ballast for centrifuge
6. Centrifuge
7. Enclosure with strong light on the top/incubator



## Steps

0. Select cultures that are in the log growth phase and check them under the microscope to characterise motility. A small-medium fraction of cells mst be motile and also there should be presence of a lot of small cells. Also check if the cultures are clean (do not show signs of contamination).

1. Transfer the cultures to an opaque concial centrifuge tube with proper aseptic standards.

2. Place the cell culture in the centrifuge and spin at **200rcf (g)** for **10 minutes**. These number change from one strain to the other.

3. After the centrifugation finishes, carefully replace the cap with parafilm and put it in the incubator with a strong light source on the top.

4. Incubate for **3mins **for **light separation**. During this time good swimmers swim to the top.
	
5. After this is done, isolate 35% of the cell culture into broad lid vials (Vss). The following table can be used to get the correct volume/densities:

	| Volume (mL) | 35% Volume (mL) | 40% Volume (mL) |
	| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
	| 1           | 0.35            | 0.4             |
	| 1.5         | 0.525           | 0.6             |
	| 2           | 0.7             | 0.8             |
	| 6           | 2.1             | 2.4             |
	| 7           | 2.45            | 2.8             |
	| 8           | 2.8             | 3.2             |
	| 9           | 3.15            | 3.6             |
	| 10          | 3.5             | 4.0             |
	| 12          | 4.2             | 4.8             |
	| 15          | 5.25            | 6.0             |
	| 16          | 5.6             | 6.4             |
	| 17          | 5.95            | 6.8             |
	| 18          | 6.3             | 7.2             |
	| 19          | 6.65            | 7.6             |
	| 20          | 7.0             | 8.0             |

6. The density of these cultures should be around $10^5$ cells per mL. The culture can be further diluted by addition of fresh media to about $\approx 10^{5}-10^{4}$ cells. These cell densities are too low to count.

	> You can use the formula: C1V1 = C2V2 and Vadd = V2 - Vss

7. The culture is ready for use. Shade the shott bottle with Aluminium foil or a proper system and store in a dark place for dark acclimation.
