# Microfluidics requirements

**Current status:** As of now, we have everything we need at the GIMM Oeiras site. Jorge Carvalho wants to take the plasma cleaner and the cutting plotter. Edgar Gomes has a plasma cleaner, so we would have to buy a cutting plotter.

**Steps**:

We need an isolated clean space for all of the processes mentioned below.

1. Cleaning glass
	+ Ultrasonic bath and glass racks (for sonicaton)
	+ Nitrogen line and air pistol (for blow drying)
	+ Acid disposal container and acid proof gloves (for Piranha washing)
	+ Laminar flow hood (for general isolation)
2. PDMS mixing
	+ PDMS part A (elastomer) and B (curing agent)
	+ Weight scale (for measuring)
	+ Vaccum line and descicator (for removing bubbles)
3. Pouring and curing
	+ Hot plates X2 (for curing)
4. Cutting, punching, washing
	+ Swiss scalpel blades (for cutting)
	+ Stereoscope (for cutting and observing mould)
	+ Nitrogen line and air pistol (for blow drying)
5. Plasma cleaning and bonding
	+ Plasma cleaner with Vaccum, Argon, and Oxygen lines (for PDMS bonding)
	+ Cutting plotter (for creating masks to prevent bonding of specific areas)
6. Heat treatment and attachemnt of ports
	+ Hot plates X2 (for strengthning the plasma bonding)
	+ UV lamp (for curing UV glue)

7. Silanization of the master moulds and glass:
	+ Ultrasonic bath and glass racks (for sonicaton)
	+ Nitrogen line and air pistol (for blow drying)
	+ An oven (for heat treatment)
	+ A refrigerator (for storing the Silane reagents)
