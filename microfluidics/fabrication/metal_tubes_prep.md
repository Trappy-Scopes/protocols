# Preparation of metal tubes for microfluidic porting

+ The metal tubes form the interface between the PDMS and the silicone tubing.

## Requirements

1. Disposable needles Sterican® blunt bevel facet, 21 G, 22 mm, 0.80 mm
2. Hardware protection gloves
3. Pliers
4. Hot plate
5. Shott bottle for autoclave

## Steps

1. Remove the packaging and plastic caps from all the needles. Place the needles on a **hot plate at 75 °C for 10–20 minutes** to soften the glue and plastic.
2. Using **pliers**, crush and twist the **green plastic section** just above the glue. The needle should **dislodge** with the glue still attached to the metal part.
3. Leave the glue intact to avoid generating unnecessary dust. Collect the needles in a **short glass bottle**.
4. **Autoclave** the needles at **121 °C for 10 minutes**, then transfer the autoclaved bottle to the **cleanroom**.
