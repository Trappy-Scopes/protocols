# Preparation of scotch tape circles for microfluidics

+ The scotch tape circles cover the trap and the walls during the bionding stage. This prevents bonding of the walls to the glass,

## Requirements

1. 3M™ Scotch tape
2. Clear aceetate sheet (translucent with matte finish)

## Steps

1. Take a clean piece of **acetate sheet**. Clean it further with **isopropyl alcohol** and **blow dry** with **nitrogen**.
2. Apply **parallel strips of Scotch tape** without any creasing. Cut the tape at the corners to prevent overlapping or sticking.
3. Place the sheet on a **cutting plotter (GCC RX II Series)** and cut **consecutive 9.5 mm diameter circles** with just enough pressure to cut through the tape but not the acetate sheet.
4. Store the sheet **without removing the excess tape**. The excess can be removed during subsequent use to prevent dust accumulation.
5. **To apply:** Use **flat tweezers** to gently remove a circular piece from the acetate sheet (peel the excess tape first, if needed).
6. Apply the circle to the **PDMS device** using another pair of tweezers. Ensure good contact and that the **walls are completely covered**.
