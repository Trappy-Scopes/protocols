# Preparation of concentrated Piranha solution



## Requirements

1. Concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$ (Concentrated hydrochloric acid)
2. 30 %w/w $H_2O_2$​ (Hyfrogen peroxide)
3. Glass beakers
4. Proper protection equipment - special gloves to handle the acid botttles.

## Steps

1. Mix concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$ and 30 %w/w $H_2O_2$ in a 3:1 ratio respectively. Always add $H_{2}SO_{4}$​ first, never the opposite or it might cause an explosion. 
	**Safety note:** The reasultant reaction is extremely exothermic and vigorous, which can cause serious injuries. Mix the solution in a glass beaker, which is placed inside a wider glass vessel to prevent any spillage outside.
2. Wait for a few minutes (~10) for the reaction vessel to calm and cool down. Then cover the rreaction vessel with aluminum foil to trap in dangerous fumes. Make sure that the solution does not react with the Aluminium foil as it is corrosoive to Alumiunum.
	**Safety note**: Avoid inhaling the fumes as they are corrosive to the lungs. Use special gloves to handle the solution vessel and the covered aluminium foil. The reaaction vessel also becomes very hot during the reaction and should be handled carefully.
