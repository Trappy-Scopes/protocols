# Preparation of BSA stock solution

+ We assume that 5mL of BSA solution is required to treat each device. For 3 experiment devices a week and an average of 10 devices a day (8+2 reserve), we need a total of $5mL*3*10=150mL$ of BSA solution a week.
+ **It is not recommended to store BSA solution for more than a week.** Hence, preparation should be done on a weekly basis.
+ The protcol is intensed for 0.15% (w/w) of BSA.



## Requirements

1. BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) isolate
2. Deinonised distilled water
3. Beakers (250mL)
4. Magnetic stirrer
5. Shott botttle (autoclaved) : 250mL

## Steps

1. Measure 150mL of water in a 250mL beaker on a weighing scale. The weight should be about 150g.
2. Measure 0.225g of BSA and add it to the beaker.
3. Cover it with parafilm and stir with a magnetic stirrer until it dissolves. (TODO: Check the time)
4. Once dissolved, transfer the solution to a Shott bottle and store it in 4ÂºC refrigerator. Label the date of preparation.







# Treatment of microfluidic devices

1. Here we describe the treatment procedure for microfluidic devices. The treatment is done after assembly of the devices.
2. Use syringe filters which are compatible with dissolved protein. The ones used below are ideal.

## Requirements

1. Assembled microfluidic devices (with tubing and 3-way valves)
2. BSA stock solution, prepared within <=1 week, 50mL for 10 devices.
3. 20mL syringe (sterile)
4. $0.20 \mu m$ Cellulose acetate syringe filter (Corning CLS431219 cellulose acetate membrane (surfactant-free), diam. 28 mm)
5. Sterile TAP media (30mL for 8 devices)
6. One beaker for outlet



## Steps

1.  Clean the surface of the bench and assemble the microfluidic devices after sterlization procedures are complete.
2. Use a 20mL syringe to load the BSA stock solution and attach a new sterile syringe filter
3. Connect the filter to the 3 way-valve with the tertiary valve closed and purge each device.
4. Leave the device in a pressurised state with  BSA solution for **30mins** at room temperature.
5. After 30mins, purge eahc device with TAP media. Pass atleast 3mL, which is the volume of the device.
