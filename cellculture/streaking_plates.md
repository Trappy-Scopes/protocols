# Protocol for streaking of agar plates

## Requirements

1. TAP+P+Agar plates (new and with viable culture)
2. Inoculating loop (VWR)
3. Parafilm, Laminar flow (sterile space)

## 1. Streaking  plates

1. Flip the plates to use and label them on the base(b) (due to the water drops formed during condensation).
2. With an inoculation loop, take a small portion of cells from either a sample or an inoculated agar plate (if this is the case, it should preferably be from an isolated dot, distant from possible contaminations).
3. With not much pressure, continuously draw a horizontal streak on the plate using the loop. Trash that loop. 
4. With a new loop, make a vertical streak of about **1 cm**, starting in the end of the previous streak, up to down. Continuously, make a “zig zag” streak until the end of the plate (figure below).
5. Close the plate, upside down, and seal with Parafilm.
6. Label according to label scheme. Consult cellculture process chart.
7. Put the plates near the light source.
